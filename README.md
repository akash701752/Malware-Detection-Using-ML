## Introduction

Malware detection is crucial for ensuring the security of computer systems and networks. This project explores the use of machine learning algorithms to classify files as either benign or malicious based on a set of features extracted from the files.

Three machine learning classifiers were employed:
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- AdaBoost Classifier

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of files with labeled data, where each file is characterized by a set of features extracted from its content and attributes.

You can find the dataset [here](link-to-dataset).

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/malware-detection.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd malware-detection

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the classifiers.
bash
jupyter notebook malware_detection.ipynb


## Results
After training and evaluating the three classifiers, we found that the Random Forest Classifier outperformed the others in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. Here are the key results:

Random Forest Classifier:
Accuracy: 99.45309670409273%
Precision: 0.99%
Recall: 0.99%

Gradient Boosting Classifier:
Accuracy: 98.8228902571532%
Precision: 0.99%
Recall: 0.99%

AdaBoost Classifier:
Accuracy: 98.69974646867077%
Precision: 0.99%
Recall: 0.99%


## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in malware detection. Among the classifiers tested, the Random Forest Classifier performed the best, providing the highest accuracy, precision, and recall. However, further optimization and feature engineering may lead to even better results.
