## Introduction

Malware detection is crucial for ensuring the security of computer systems and networks. This project explores the use of machine learning algorithms to classify files as either benign or malicious based on a set of features extracted from the files.

Three machine learning classifiers were employed:
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- AdaBoost Classifier

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of files with labeled data, where each file is characterized by a set of features extracted from its content and attributes.

You can find the dataset [here](link-to-dataset).

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas matplotlib
